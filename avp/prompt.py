        prompt = f"""You are an expert video analysis planner. Create a concise, single-action observation plan (ONE step) to answer the user's query this round.

    **User Query:** {full_query}

    **Video Information:**
    - Duration: {duration} seconds

    **Planning Framework:**
    Each action A_t in your plan must specify three key components:
    1. **Goal (Reasoning Objective)**: The step's reasoning objective - what you're trying to accomplish
       - Examples: "localize a key event", "recognize a fine-grained cue", "identify an anomaly", 
         "count objects", "determine spatial relationships", "extract text/numbers", "analyze temporal sequence"
       - This should be clearly stated in the "description" field
    2. **Region**: The temporal span in the video to examine
       - Can be the whole video (uniform mode) or specific temporal spans (region mode)
       - Specified via "load_mode" ("uniform" for full video, "region" for specific spans)
       - For region mode, provide exact [start, end] timestamps in seconds in the "regions" field
    3. **Sampling Granularity**: The fps (frames per second) and resolution settings
       - "fps": Controls temporal sampling rate (0.1-5.0, lower = sparser sampling)
       - "spatial_token_rate": Controls spatial resolution ("low" or "medium", lower = coarser spatial detail)

    **Your Planning Strategy:**
    1. **Coarse-to-Fine Strategy**: Start with broad uniform scans (low fps, low resolution) to locate candidate regions, then zoom in with higher detail.
    2. **Efficiency**: Balance thoroughness with computational cost.
    
    **CRITICAL: SINGLE ACTION REQUIREMENT (THIS ROUND):**
    - You MUST output EXACTLY ONE observation action (ONE item in the `steps` array).
    - Set the `sub_query` to the EXACT SAME text as the original user query (including options if provided).
    - Decide the single action’s region/uniform, fps, and spatial_token_rate to best gather query-relevant evidence now.
    
    **Timestamp Handling (CRITICAL - Read Carefully):**
    
    **First, determine the query type:**
    - **Factual questions**: Questions asking about facts, counts, identities, states, or properties (e.g., "what", "how many", "who", "which", "count", "identify", "what color", "what is the number")
    - **Reasoning/explanation questions**: Questions asking about causes, reasons, explanations, processes, or motivations (e.g., "why", "how", "explain", "reason", "cause", "purpose", "why did", "how did", "what led to")
    
    **RULE 1: Exact timestamp ranges with start AND end:**
    - If the query specifies BOTH a start AND end time (e.g., "07:15 - 07:18", "from 2:00 to 2:30", "between 2:00 and 2:30"):
      * **For FACTUAL questions**: Use the EXACT timestamps - DO NOT add padding.
        - Convert directly: "07:15 - 07:18" → [435.0, 438.0] seconds (EXACTLY, no padding)
        - Example: "How many pieces are out at 07:15 - 07:18?" → regions: [[435.0, 438.0]] - use exactly 3 seconds
      * **For REASONING/EXPLANATION questions**: Add padding (15-30 seconds before/after) to provide context.
        - Convert: "07:15 - 07:18" → [435-15, 438+15] = [420.0, 453.0] seconds (adds context)
        - Example: "Why did the player move at 07:15 - 07:18?" → regions: [[420.0, 453.0]] - needs context to understand the reason
    
    **RULE 2: Single specific timestamp (exact time):**
    - If the query mentions a single timestamp WITHOUT "around/near/about" (e.g., "at 1:23", "at 02:15"):
      * **For FACTUAL questions**: Use a forward 1-second window starting from that timestamp.
        - Convert: "at 1:23" (83 seconds) → [83.0, 84.0] for 1 second starting at that exact moment
        - Example: "What is the score at 02:15?" → [135.0, 136.0] - 1 second window starting at 02:15
      * **For REASONING/EXPLANATION questions**: Add padding (15-30 seconds before/after) to understand context.
        - Convert: "at 1:23" (83 seconds) → [83-15, 83+15] = [68.0, 98.0] (30-second window for context)
        - Example: "Why did the player act at 02:15?" → [120.0, 150.0] - needs context to understand why
    
    **RULE 3: Approximate or vague timing:**
    - If the query uses words like "around/near/about this time" (e.g., "around 1:23", "near 02:15"), use a segment window.
    - Convert: "around 1:23" → [83-15, 83+15] = [68.0, 98.0] (30-second window)
    - If the query mentions vague timing without specific seconds (e.g., "near the beginning", "around the end"), use longer segments (30 seconds or more)
    
    **CRITICAL:** 
    - For FACTUAL questions with exact timestamps: respect them precisely (no padding)
    - For REASONING/EXPLANATION questions with exact timestamps: add 15-30 seconds padding before/after to understand context
    - Only use padding/windows when the query explicitly says "around/near/about" or when timing is vague
    
    All explicit timestamps must be interpreted as seconds from the start of the original video.

    **Segment Length Rule:**
    - When targeting a specific event/action with VAGUE timing, use segments that are **at least 30 seconds** long whenever possible.
    - **EXCEPTIONS for exact timestamps:** 
      * **Factual questions** with exact start AND end timestamps: use them EXACTLY - no padding, no 30-second rule.
      * **Factual questions** with a single exact timestamp: use a forward 1-second window starting from that timestamp (e.g., timestamp 45 → [45.0, 46.0]).
      * **Reasoning/explanation questions** with exact timestamps: still add padding (15-30 seconds) to understand context.

    **Heuristic Hints (if duration is known for this single action):**
    - If the query mentions "opening"/"beginning", consider [0, 30].
    - If the query mentions "end"/"ending", consider [max(0, duration - 30), duration].
    - If timing is completely unknown, begin with a uniform scan at low fps (0.25-1.0) and LOW or MEDIUM spatial token rate.

    **Step Configuration Guidelines (choose ONE for this step):**
    - Uniform scan of the full video when timing is unknown
      - load_mode: "uniform"; fps: 0.25–1.0; spatial_token_rate: "low" or "medium"; regions: []
    - Region analysis when explicit timestamps/ranges are given or strongly implied
      - load_mode: "region"; fps: ~2.0; spatial_token_rate: "low" or "medium"; regions: [[start, end]]

---

**Your Task:**
Based on the evidence gathered so far and what's still missing, plan a NEW single observation action to gather additional evidence.

**Replanning Strategy:**
1. **Analyze what's missing**: What aspects of the query are not yet answered by the evidence?
2. **Avoid redundancy**: Don't re-observe the same regions with the same parameters
3. **Try different approaches**:
   - If previous uniform scan found nothing → try focused regions based on hints in the query
   - If previous region search failed → try uniform scan with different fps/resolution
   - If evidence is ambiguous → try higher fps or different spatial resolution
   - If specific timestamps mentioned in query → focus on those exact regions

**Planning Guidelines:**
- load_mode: "uniform" (full video) or "region" (specific time spans)
- fps: 0.1-5.0 (lower = sparser sampling, higher = denser)
- spatial_token_rate: "low" or "medium" (lower = coarser spatial detail)
- regions: [[start, end]] in seconds (empty for uniform mode)

**IMPORTANT:** Generate exactly ONE observation action (steps array must have exactly 1 item).

**Output Format (STRICT JSON ONLY):**
The steps array MUST contain exactly ONE item.

**Statement to Ground:** {statement}

**Video Information:**
- Duration: {duration} seconds

**Planning Framework:**
Each action must specify three key components:
1. **Goal (Reasoning Objective)**: What you're trying to accomplish
   - Examples: "locate temporal region where statement occurs", "identify precise time boundaries of the event", 
     "find the start and end of the action described in the statement"
   - This should be clearly stated in the "description" field
2. **Region**: The temporal span in the video to examine
   - Can be the whole video (uniform mode) or specific temporal spans (region mode)
   - Specified via "load_mode" ("uniform" for full video, "region" for specific spans)
   - For region mode, provide exact [start, end] timestamps in seconds in the "regions" field
3. **Sampling Granularity**: The fps (frames per second) and resolution settings
   - "fps": Controls temporal sampling rate (0.1-5.0, lower = sparser sampling)
   - "spatial_token_rate": Controls spatial resolution ("low" or "medium", lower = coarser spatial detail)

**Your Planning Strategy:**
1. **Coarse-to-Fine Strategy**: Start with broad uniform scans (low fps, low resolution) to locate candidate regions, then zoom in with higher detail.
2. **Efficiency**: Balance thoroughness with computational cost.

**CRITICAL: SINGLE ACTION REQUIREMENT (THIS ROUND):**
- You MUST output EXACTLY ONE observation action (ONE item in the `steps` array).
- Set the `sub_query` to the EXACT SAME text as the original statement.
- Decide the single action's region/uniform, fps, and spatial_token_rate to best gather evidence for temporal grounding.

**Temporal Grounding Strategy:**
- If the statement describes a specific event/action with no timing hints, start with uniform scan (low fps, low spatial) to locate candidate regions
- If previous rounds found candidate regions, use region mode with higher fps and medium spatial to refine boundaries
- Focus on identifying precise start and end timestamps where the statement is true

**Step Configuration Guidelines (choose ONE for this step):**
- Uniform scan of the full video when timing is unknown
  - load_mode: "uniform"; fps: 0.25–1.0; spatial_token_rate: "low"; regions: []
- Region analysis when candidate regions are known or strongly implied
  - load_mode: "region"; fps: ~2.0; spatial_token_rate: "medium"; regions: [[start, end]]

**Few-Shot Exemplars (JSON):**

- Initial uniform scan (no timing hints):
{{
"reasoning": "Statement describes an event with no timing information. Start with uniform scan to locate candidate regions.",
"steps": [
    {{
    "step_id": "1",
    "description": "Scan entire video to locate temporal region where person enters the red car",
    "sub_query": "The person enters the red car",
    "load_mode": "uniform",
    "fps": 0.5,
    "spatial_token_rate": "low",
    "regions": []
    }}
],
"completion_criteria": "Observation complete when candidate temporal regions are identified"
}}

- Refinement with region mode (after initial scan):
{{
"reasoning": "Previous uniform scan found candidate region around 45-60s. Refine with higher fps and medium spatial to get precise boundaries.",
"steps": [
    {{
    "step_id": "1",
    "description": "Refine temporal boundaries of person entering red car with higher detail",
    "sub_query": "The person enters the red car",
    "load_mode": "region",

    "regions": [[45.0, 60.0]]
    }}
